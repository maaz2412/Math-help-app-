# Math-help-app-
Hello everyone my name is Maaz Tahir. I am a software engineering freshmen in college. I made this basic console based math help application using C++ that can be used by students to perform some basic maths function such as:
1. Performing basic arithmetic operations
2. Solving a quadratic equation using three inputs(coefficients of the equation)
3. Calculating area of a triangle
4. Converting base 10 decimal type number to a binary number

I made this using basic concepts such as classes,functions,loops and conditionals. This was a great source of practice.
